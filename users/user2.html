        <h1>Galadriel</h1>
        <p class="info_text">(power_magick) 2017/05/13 10:30:59</p>
        <p>Galadriel was born in Valinor during the Years of the Trees before the First Age had even begun. Much of
            Galadriel's story is confusing, and there are several distinct tales told about her collected in the
            Unfinished Tales. According to the older account, used in the published Silmarillion, Galadriel was an eager
            participant and leader in the rebellion of the Ã‘oldor and their flight from Valinor due to her desire to one
            day rule over a patch of Middle-earth herself.
