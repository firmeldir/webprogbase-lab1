        <h1>Thranduil</h1>
        <p class="info_text">(elvish_lord) 2014/05/13 16:30:59</p>
        <p>The son of Orofer, father of Legolas. When his father Orofer went with his army to help Elendil in the battle
            of Dagorlad during the War of the Last Alliance, Thranduil agreed to go with his father. In this battle,
            Orofer died, and Thranduil became the king of the forest.
            The exact date of birth is unknown. As stated in The Unfinished Tales, both Orofer and Thranduil are elves
            from Doriath, who, after his destruction by the sons of Feanor and the gnomes of Nogrod, went east at the
            beginning of the Second Age, and, having crossed the Dark Mountains, founded the kingdom of forest elves
            there. According to the text of The Hobbit, he had golden hair.
