        <h1>History</h1>
        <p>History (from Greek ἱστορία, historia, meaning 'inquiry; knowledge acquired by investigation')[2] is the past
            as it is described in written documents, and the study thereof.[3][4] Events occurring before written
            records are considered prehistory. "History" is an umbrella term that relates to past events as well as the
            memory, discovery, collection, organization, presentation, and interpretation of information about these
            events. Scholars who write about history are called historians. </p>
